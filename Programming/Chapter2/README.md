# NA-24 Fall Programming Chapter 2

This project contains the code and files for Chapter 2 of the NA-24 Fall Programming course.
## Directory Structure

- **bin/**: Compiled binary files and executable outputs.
- **figures/**: Contains figures and images used in the report or generated by the code.
- **include/**: Header files including `Intepolator.hpp`.
- **plotCode/**: Python scripts used to generate plots and figures.
- **src/**: C++ source code files for the project, including the main logic.

- **report.tex**: LaTeX source file for the report.

## how to run the code

- **make run** : to compile and run all the programs.
  
- **make clean** : to clean the bin directory.
- **make report** : to compile the report.
- **make B** : to compile ProblemB.cpp and run it once, similar for other problems, like `make C` , `make D` and etc.

And if you want to run the python code to generate the plots, you can run the following command:
```sh
cd plotCode
python3 plotB.py
```
plotB.py can be replaced with any other plot code.

## Dependencies
To run Plot code successfully, you may nedd some python libs such as **numpy**, **matplotlib**, **scipy**
you can intall them by running the following command:
```sh
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
```
