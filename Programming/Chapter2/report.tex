\section{A. Interpolator Design}

\subsection{Class Structure and Inheritance}
The \textbf{Interpolator} class serves as a base class, which is inherited by the derived classes \textbf{NewtonInterpolator} and \textbf{HermiteInterpolator}.\\
As in problem F, the interpolation object is a point. Therefore, I designed the \textbf{Point} class and another base class, \textbf{PointInterpolator}, which is inherited by \textbf{BezierInterpolator}.

\subsection{Newton Interpolator}
The \textbf{NewtonInterpolator} class is derived from the \textbf{Interpolator} base class. It is designed to perform Newton's interpolation. The class has two constructors and several member functions.

The first constructor takes two vectors, \texttt{x\_values} and \texttt{f\_values}, which represent the x-coordinates and corresponding function values, respectively. It initializes the divided differences table and calls the \texttt{computeDividedDifferences()} function to compute it.

The second constructor takes a function object and a vector of x-coordinates. It evaluates the function at each x-coordinate to obtain the corresponding function values and then initializes the divided differences table.

The \texttt{interpolate()} function performs the interpolation for a given x-value using the precomputed divided differences.

The \texttt{printInternalData()} function prints the internal data, including the x-values and the main dialog of divided differences table.

The \texttt{computeDividedDifferences()} function computes the divided differences table. The following is the pseudocode:
\begin{lstlisting}
for i = 0 to n
    dd[i][0] = f[i]
for j = 1 to n
    for i = j to n
        dd[i][j] = (dd[i][j-1] - dd[i-1][j-1]) / (x[i] - x[i-j])
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Hermite Interpolator}
The \textbf{HermiteInterpolator} class is derived from the \textbf{Interpolator} base class. It is designed to perform Hermite interpolation, which takes into account both function values and their derivatives at given points. The class has a constructor and several member functions.

For simplicity of design, I only considered the case where all interpolation points have first derivatives and no higher-order derivatives, which meets the requirements of problem D.

The constructor takes three vectors of \texttt{same size}: \texttt{x\_values}, \texttt{y\_values}, and \texttt{yDerivative\_values}. It initializes the divided differences table and calls the \texttt{computeCoefficients()} function to compute it.

The \texttt{interpolate()} function performs the interpolation for a given x-value using the precomputed divided differences.

The \texttt{printInternalData()} function prints the internal data, including the x-values and the main dialog of divided differences table.

The \texttt{computeCoefficients()} function computes the divided differences table. The following is the pseudocode:
\begin{lstlisting}
n = x.size()
z = new array of size 2*n
for i = 0 to n-1
  z[2*i] = x[i]
  z[2*i + 1] = x[i]
  dd[2*i][0] = y[i]
  dd[2*i + 1][0] = y[i]
  dd[2*i + 1][1] = yd[i]
  if i > 0
    dd[2*i][1] = (y[i] - y[i-1]) / (x[i] - x[i-1])
for j = 2 to 2*n-1
  for i = j to 2*n-1
    dd[i][j] = (dd[i][j-1] - dd[i-1][j-1]) / (z[i] - z[i-j])
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Bezier Interpolator}
The \textbf{BezierInterpolator} class is derived from the \textbf{PointInterpolator} base class. It is designed to perform cubic Bezier interpolation. The class has a constructor and several member functions.

The constructor takes a vector of control points sets, where each set contains exactly four points. It initializes the control points sets and checks if they are valid. If any set does not contain exactly four points, an exception is thrown.

The \texttt{Interpolate()} function performs the interpolation for a given parameter \( t \) in the range \([0, 1]\). It first determines the appropriate segment for the given \( t \) and maps \( t \) to the local range \([0, 1]\) within that segment. It then calls the \texttt{calculateBezierPoint()} function to compute the interpolated point.

The \texttt{calculateBezierPoint()} function computes the Bezier point for a given set of control points and a parameter \( t \). It uses the cubic Bezier formula:
\[
\mathbf{P}(t) = (1-t)^3 \mathbf{P}_0 + 3(1-t)^2 t \mathbf{P}_1 + 3(1-t) t^2 \mathbf{P}_2 + t^3 \mathbf{P}_3
\]
where \(\mathbf{P}_0, \mathbf{P}_1, \mathbf{P}_2, \mathbf{P}_3\) are the control points.

\section{B. Runge Phenomenon}
First, I implemented the Runge function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + x^2} \) and computed the interpolating polynomials. Then, I plotted the function and its interpolating polynomials in the range \([-1, 1]\) using Python. The resulting plot is shown in Figure \ref{fig:runge}.
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figures/Runge.png}
    \caption{Runge Phenomenon}
    \label{fig:runge}
\end{figure}

From the plot, we can observe that the interpolating polynomials exhibit oscillations near the endpoints of the interval \([-1, 1]\) and do not converge uniformly to the function.

\section{C. Chebychev Interpolate}
First, I generate the Chebyshev nodes in the interval \([-1, 1]\) and evaluate the Runge function at these nodes. Then, I perform Newton's interpolation using the Chebyshev nodes and plot the interpolating polynomial. The resulting plot is shown in Figure \ref{fig:chebyshev}.
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figures/Chebyshev.png}
    \caption{Chebyshev interpolation}
    \label{fig:chebyshev}
\end{figure}

From the plot, we can observe that the interpolating polynomial using Chebyshev nodes exhibits less oscillation near the endpoints of the interval \([-1, 1]\) compared to the interpolating polynomial using equidistant nodes.

\section{D. Hermite Interpolation}
I implemented the Hermite interpolation algorithm and following is the result:
\begin{lstlisting}
  (a) The position at t = 10 seconds: 712.774 feet
  (b) The maximum velocity is 81.2615 feet/second, reached at t = 6.678 seconds
   The maximum velocity exceeds 81 feet/second
\end{lstlisting}
In the second question, I use the secant to subtitute the slope of the function, in other words, I use mean velocity to subtitute velocity. And by Langrange mean value theorem, we can know that the car reached 81.2615 feet/second at some moment between 6.678 and 6.679 seconds.

\section{E. larvae survival}
First, I try to use Newton interpolation to fit the data. The result is shown in Figure \ref{fig:larvae28} and Figure \ref{fig:larvae43}.
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{minipage}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/larvae28days.png}
    \caption{Larvae's weight in 28 days with Newton interpolation}
    \label{fig:larvae28}
  \end{minipage}
  \hfill
  \begin{minipage}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/larvae43days.png}
    \caption{Larvae's weight in 43 days with Newton interpolation}
    \label{fig:larvae43}
  \end{minipage}
  \vfill
  \begin{minipage}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/cubicspline.png}
    \caption{Larvae's weight in 43 days with cubic spline interpolation}
    \label{fig:larvaeCubicSpline}
  \end{minipage}
  \hfill
  \begin{minipage}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/expfit.png}
    \caption{Exponential fitting}
    \label{fig:expfit}
  \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

From Figure \ref{fig:larvae28}, we can observe that overfitting occurs, and sample 1 even shows negative weight values in the first five days.

In Figure \ref{fig:larvae43}, we can see that weight in 43 day shows in even greater deviations. This is because we should not use interpolation polynomials to estimate points beyond the range of our data.

To fix this, I tried to use the cubic spline interpolator, and the result is shown in Figure \ref{fig:larvaeCubicSpline}. It is much better than the Newton interpolator, but it still shows some problems.

Finally, I found that the last part of the data can be better fitted using an exponential function plus a constant, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:expfit}. This method provides a better fit for the data, leading us to conclude that sample 1 will not die in 43 days, while sample 2 will.

Unfortunately, I did not implement the cubic spline interpolator and exponential fit in this homework. These parts of the code were generated using Python with the assistance of ChatGPT-4.

By the way, it is advisable to add two private member variables, \texttt{minX} and \texttt{maxX}, to the \textbf{Interpolator} class. These variables will store the range of the interpolation data and will throw an exception if the input x-value is out of this range.

\section{F. Bezier Interpolation}
First, I noticed that the function graph of the planar curve is symmetric about the y-axis, so I only considered the part where \( x \geq 0 \) during interpolation, and then obtained the entire planar curve through symmetry. Correspondingly, when selecting control points later, I also selected only half the number of points. And at this point, the equation of the function can be simplified to \( x^2 + \left(\frac{3}{2}y - \sqrt{x}\right)^2 = 3 \).

To correctly use Algorithm 2.74, I first parameterized the points on the planar curve:
\[
\begin{cases}
  x = \sqrt{3} \sin(\pi t), \\
  \frac{3}{2}y - \sqrt{x} = \sqrt{3} \cos(\pi t)
\end{cases}
\implies
\begin{cases}
  x = \sqrt{3} \sin(\pi t), \\
  y = \frac{2}{3} \left( \sqrt{3} \cos(\pi t) + \sqrt{x} \right)
\end{cases}
\]
where \( t \in [0, 1] \).

Taking the derivatives, we get:
\[
\begin{cases}
  \frac{dx}{dt} &= \sqrt{3} \cos(\pi t), \\
  \frac{dy}{dt} &= -\frac{2}{3} \left( \sqrt{3} \sin(\pi t) + \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}} \frac{dx}{dt} \right).
\end{cases}
\]

In fact, I found that Algorithm 2.74 has some issues. It does not adjust the length of the tangent vector \(\gamma'\) based on the distance between \(p_j\) and \(p_{j+1}\). As \(m\) increases and the step size decreases, the length of \(\gamma'\) does not decrease accordingly, which leads to some problems. To achieve better results, I modified Algorithm 2.74 by setting the lengths of \(\gamma'(p_j)\) and \(\gamma'(p_{j+1})\) to be the distance between \(p_j\) and \(p_{j+1}\).

Then I obtained the control points using modified Algorithm 2.74, including the characteristic points \((0, \pm \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}})\), which are taken at \( t = 0 \) and \( t = 1 \).

Next, I used the C++ program to generate enough points for each interpolation curve and stored them in the `pointsInF.txt` file in the `plotCode` folder. Then, I used a Python program to plot the results. The results for different \(m\) are shown in the following figures, while Figure \ref{fig:planar curve} is the original curve.
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{minipage}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/bezier0.png}
    \caption{planar curve}
    \label{fig:planar curve}
  \end{minipage}
  \hfill
  \begin{minipage}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/bezier_update1.png}
    \caption{interpolated planar curve with m = 10}
    \label{fig:bezierm10}
  \end{minipage}
  \vfill
  \begin{minipage}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/bezier_update2.png}
    \caption{interpolated planar curve with m = 40}
    \label{fig:bezierm40}
  \end{minipage}
  \hfill
  \begin{minipage}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/bezier_update3.png}
    \caption{interpolated planar curve with m = 160}
    \label{fig:bezierm160}
  \end{minipage}
\end{figure}



From the figures, we can see that when \( m = 10 \), the original curve is already well-fitted. As \( m \) increases, the curve becomes smoother and closer to the original curve. When \( m = 40 \), the curve is already almost indistinguishable from the original curve. 

To have a more intuitive understanding of the curve fitting effect, I wrote a program to calculate the maximum distance between the original curve and the interpolated curve. Since the fitting effect near the endpoints is not very good, I also calculated the maximum distance when \( t \in (0.2, 0.8) \). The results are shown in the table below:

We can see from Table \ref{tab:interpolation_distances} that as \( m \) increases, the maximum distance decreases significantly.
\begin{table}[H]

  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    \textbf{m} & \textbf{Max Distance} & \textbf{Max Distance (t in (0.2, 0.8))} \\

    \hline
    40 & 0.0824217 & 0.00237979 \\
